__Context-free Languages__

_ict chapter 17_


‚òØ Theorem 1 
---
CFLs are closed under `union, product, and Kleene closure`. 
- i.e. given two CFLs: L‚ÇÅ and L‚ÇÇ, 
- `‚ù∂ L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ, ‚ù∑L‚ÇÅL‚ÇÇ, and ‚ù∏L‚ÇÅ*` are all `context-free`.

‚ö†Ô∏è `NOT true` for the `complement` and `intersection` of CFLs since
- some are `non-context-free`
- some are `context-free`


Prove by construction:
- suppose L‚ÇÅ, L‚ÇÇ can be generated by CFG1 and CFG2 respectively
  - rename their nonterminals to avoid name conflict
  - add new nonterminal S and new production rules to the combination of CFG1 and CFG2 
- for `‚ù∂ L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ`, add
  - `S ‚Üí S‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÇ` 
  - this is the CFG of L‚ÇÅ+L‚ÇÇ since
    - all words in L‚ÇÅ can be generated by S ‚Üí S‚ÇÅ and CFG1
    - all words in L‚ÇÇ can be generated by S ‚Üí S‚ÇÇ and CFG2
  - this can also be done with PDAs (p1)
    - ex. (p2-3)
- for `‚ù∑L‚ÇÅL‚ÇÇ`, add
  - `S ‚Üí S‚ÇÅ S‚ÇÇ`
  - by PDAs (p4)
    - ex. (p5-6)
    - try running `(baabbb)(aa)`
- for `‚ù∏L‚ÇÅ*`, add
  - `S ‚Üí S‚ÇÅS | Œµ`



üçé Example 1
---
Given 
- L‚ÇÅ the PALINDROME with CFG1: S‚ÜíaSa | bSb | a | b | Œµ
- L‚ÇÇ = {a‚Åøb‚Åø} with CFG2: S‚ÜíaSb | Œµ

`‚ù∂ L‚ÇÅ+L‚ÇÇ` can be generated with
- `S‚ÜíS‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÇ`
- S‚ÇÅ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÅa | bS‚ÇÅb | a | b | Œµ
- S‚ÇÇ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÇb | Œµ

`‚ù∑L‚ÇÅL‚ÇÇ` can be generated with
- `S‚ÜíS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÇ`
- S‚ÇÅ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÅa | bS‚ÇÅb | a | b | Œµ
- S‚ÇÇ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÇb | Œµ

`‚ù∏L‚ÇÅ*` can be generated with
- `S‚ÜíS‚ÇÅS | Œµ`
- S‚ÇÅ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÅa | bS‚ÇÅb | a | b | Œµ


üçé Example 2
---
Given 
- L‚ÇÅ the PALINDROME with CFG1: S‚ÜíaSa | bSb | a | b | Œµ over Œ£‚ÇÅ = {a,b}
- L‚ÇÇ = {c‚Åød‚Åø} with CFG2: S‚ÜícSd | Œµ over Œ£‚ÇÇ = {c,d}

Then `L‚ÇÅ+L‚ÇÇ` can be generated with
- S‚ÜíS‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÇ
- S‚ÇÅ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÅa | bS‚ÇÅb | a | b | Œµ
- S‚ÇÇ‚ÜícS‚ÇÇd | Œµ
- over Œ£ = Œ£‚ÇÅ‚à™Œ£‚ÇÇ = {a,b,c,d}


üèÉ Exercise 1
---
Given 
- L‚ÇÅ the EVENPALINDROME with CFG1: S‚ÜíaSa | bSb | Œµ
- L‚ÇÇ the ODDPALINDROME with CFG2: S‚ÜíaSa | bSb | a | b

Then `L‚ÇÅ+L‚ÇÇ` can be generated with
- S‚ÜíS‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÇ
- S‚ÇÅ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÅa | bS‚ÇÅb | Œµ
- S‚ÇÇ‚ÜíaS‚ÇÇa | bS‚ÇÇb | a | b



‚òØ Theorem 2
---
- ‚ù∂ The `union` of a `context-free` language and a `regular` language must be `context-free`
  - because a RL is also a CFL
- but `may be regular`
  - ex 1. PALINDROME is `nonregular context-free` and ${ \mathbf{(a+b)^*} }$ is regular
    - their union is regular
  - ex 2. PALINDROME is nonregular context-free and ${ \mathbf{a^*} }$ is regular
    - their union is `nonregular context-free`
  - ex 3. {a‚Åøb‚Åø} is nonregular context-free and ${ \mathbf{b^*a^*} }$ is regular
    - their union is `nonregular`
  - ex 4. PALINDROME is nonregular context-free and the complement of ${ \mathbf{a^*} }$ is regular
    - their union is all strings so is regular
- ‚ù∑ The `intersection` of a `context-free` language L‚ÇÅ and a `regular` language L‚ÇÇ is always `context-free`
- prove by constructing a new PDA from the PDA accepts L‚ÇÅ and the FA accepts L‚ÇÇ


üçé Example
---
‚ûÄ Show the intersection of 
- the language EQUAL of words with the same total number of a 's and b's (p10)
- and the FA that accepts all words ending in the letter a (p11)

Constructing procedure: (p12-13)

---
‚ûÅ show the language DOUBLEWORD is non-context-free.

Prove by contradiction:
- if DOUBLEWORD were a CFL, then when we inter¬≠sect it with any regular language, we must get a context-free language.
