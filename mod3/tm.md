Turing machines (TMs)
---
- mathematical models for the entire family of modem-day computers
  - process inputs and produce outputs
- used to study theoretical limi¬≠tations of computability
- show certain operations can be done by computer

Definition of TM
---
A TM is a 6-element tuple `(Œ£, TAPE, TAPE HEAD, Œì, S, P)`:
- `Œ£`: an alphabet of `input` letters for building input words
- `TAPE`: a sequence of cells indexed by natural numbers
  - The `input word` is presented to the machine `one letter per cell` beginning in cell 0
  - The rest of the TAPE is initially filled with `blanks Œî's`
  - ![t00a](./img/t00a.png)
- `TAPE HEAD`: at every step
  - `reads` the content of the `current cell ‚áß` on the TAPE
  - `replaces` it with some other character
    - replacing with Œî is called `erasing`
  - `moves` one cell left or right
  - `locates` at `cell 0` initially
  - `crashes` the TM if it was instructed to move to the left of cell 0
- `Œì`: an alphabet of `output` characters
  - it may include Œ£
  - the blank Œî is neither in Œì nor in Œ£
- `S`: a finite set of `states` with
  - exactly `1 START` state from which the execution begins
    - it can be reentered
  - `0 or more HALT` states that stop the execution when they are entered
  - `0 or more other states` have no functions, typically named as `q‚ÇÅ, q‚ÇÇ, ‚ãØ, q‚Çô`
    - or simply labeled with positive numbers
- `P`: a `program` depicted as a `directed graph` consists of states and directed edges with labels in the form of `3-element tuples (œÉ, Œ≥, direction)`
  - ![t00c](./img/t00c.png)
  - `input letter œÉ read`: the character the TAPE HEAD reads from the current cell
  - `output letter Œ≥ written`: what the TAPE HEAD prints in the cell before it leaves
  - `direction moved`:
    - `L`: move one cell left
    - `R`: move one cell right
- all Turing machines are `deterministic`
  - there are no two or more edges leaving a state labeled with the same read letter
    - not allowed: 
      - ![t00b](./img/t00b.png)
  - no constraints on the number of outgoing edges from a state
    - a read letter without outgoing edges crashes the TM
    - an input string led to a HALT state stops the TM successfully
      - and this string is `accepted` by the TM

üçé Example 1
---
‚ûä Run `aba` on the TM with program P:
- ![t01a](./img/t01a.png)
- ![t00c](./img/t00c.png)
- the whole execution can be depicted by an `execution chain`
  - also called a `process chain` or `trace of execution`, or simply a `trace`
  - ![t01b](./img/t01b.png)
- the language accepted by this TM: ${\mathbf{(a+b)b(a+b)^*}}$
- ---

‚ûã TM‚ÇÇ accepts {a‚Åøb‚Åø | n=1,2,3,‚ãØ}
- Tricks in programming TMs
  - ![t02a](./img/t02a.png)
  - determine where the TAPE HEAD is by `bouncing off of landmarks`
- Trace `aabb`
  - ![t02b](./img/t02b.png)
- then `aaabbb`
  - ![t02c](./img/t02c.png) ![t02d](./img/t02d.png)

‚ûå TM‚ÇÉ accepts PALINDROME

- Trace `ababa`:

‚òØ Theorem 1
---
- Every regular language has a TM that accepts it.

Proof by construction a TM from an FA accepts the RL:
- Change the edge labels a and b to (a, a, R) and (b, b, R) respectively
- Change the `-` state to the word `START`
- Erase the `+` sign in each final state F
  - then add to F an outgoing edge labeled (Œî, Œî, R) to a `HALT` state


üçé Example 2
---
‚ûä build a TM to accept the language EVEN-EVEN
- the collection of all strings with an even number of a's and an even number of b's

| FA | TM |
|:--:|:--:|
| ![t04a](./img/t04a.png) | ![t04b](./img/t04b.png) |

‚ûã A problematic TM that accepts the language of all strings that have a double a in them somewhere
- ![t05](./img/t05.png)
- show that all the strings in `(a + b)*` can be divided into three sets on this TM:
  - Those with a double a. They are `accepted` by the TM
  - Those without aa that end in a. They `crash`.
  - Those without aa that end in b. They `loop forever`.
- These three possibilities exist for every TM
  - because the input string is just the first part of an `infinite TAPE`
  - there are always `infi¬≠nitely many Œî's` to read after the meaningful input has been exhausted

---

Input string classification by a TM
---
Every Turing machine `T` over the alphabet Œ£ divides the set of input strings into `3 classes`:
- `ACCEPT(T)` is the set of all strings leading to a `HALT` state. 
  - This is also called the lan¬≠guage accepted by T.
- `REJECT(T)` is the set of all strings that crash during execution 
  - by moving left from cell 0 
  - or by being in a state that has `no exit edge` for the read character
- `LOOP(T)` is the set of all strings that `loop forever` while running on T

---

üçé Example 3
---
A TM T that accepts the non-context-free language {a‚Åøb‚Åøa‚Åø | n=0,1,2,3,‚ãØ}
- ![t06a](./img/t06a.png)
- trace `aaabbbaaa`
- ![t06b](./img/t06b.png)
- when T halts
  - the TAPE will hold as many *'s as there were b's in the input
  - the TAPE HEAD will be in cell (n + 1, indexed from 0) when the machine halts

---

Two subprograms
---
- `INSET` inserts a letter at current cell C
- ![t07a](./img/t07a.png)
  - C and all those cells to the right of C will be shifted one cell to the right
  - implemented as a TM program
  - ![t07b](./img/t07b.png)
- `DELETE` removes the current cell C
- ![t07c](./img/t07c.png)
  - all those cells to the right of C will be shifted one cell to the left
  - implemented as a TM program
  - ![t07d](./img/t07d.png)

üçé Example 4
---
‚ûä  A TM that accepts the language EQUAL of all strings with the same number of a's and b's
- ![t08a](./img/t08a.png)
- EQUAL is context-free but nonregular
- trace `baab`
- ![t08b](./img/t08b.png)
- idea:
  - Landmark cell 0 by INSERT # into it
  - repeat the following two procedures from cell 1
    - find the first a,  change it into an X and return the TAPE HEAD to cell 1
    - find the first b,  change it into an X and return the TAPE HEAD to cell 1
  - until when we look for an a but Œî if found
    - then scan left the TAPE to be sure that all the cells contain X's and there are no un¬≠matched b's left 
    - When we encounter # on this pass, we accept the input


- ---

‚ûã Create a TM program to accept EQUAL with `DELETE`
- Landmark cell 0 by INSERT # into it
- repeat the following two procedures
  - find the first a, delete it then return the TAPE HEAD to cell 0
  - find the first b, delete it then return the TAPE HEAD to cell 0
- until it finds a Œî
  - move one cell left if what is read is # then the string is accepted
    - if what is read is b then there are excessive b's
  - if there are excessive a's, the program would crash in the hunt for the matching b
