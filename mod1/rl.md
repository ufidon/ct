__Regular Languages__

_ict chapter 9_


Regular languages
---
- A language that can be defined by a *regular expression* is called a *regular language*


‚òØ Theorem 1: regular languages are closed under union, concatena¬≠tion, and Kleene closure
---
- If L1 and L2 are regular languages, then L1 + L2, L1L2, and L1* are also regular languages
- The set of regular languages is closed under union, concatena¬≠tion, and Kleene closure


Proof 1 by REs
---
- r1 defines L1, r2 defines L2,
- ‚à¥ r1+r2 defines L1+L2, r1r2 defines L1L2, r1* defines L1*


Proof 2 by TGs
---
- Let TG1 accept L1 and TG2 accept L2,
  - suppose or make TG1 and TG2 each have a unique start state and a unique separate final state

- TS = TG1+TG2
  - ![sum](./img/r00.png)

- TC = TG1TG2
  - ![pro](./img/r01.png)

- TK = TG1*
  - ![clo](./img/r02.png)


üçé Example 1
---
Let Œ£={a,b} and
- L1 = all words of two or more letters that begin and end with the same letter
  - $`\mathbf{r1 = a(a+b)^*a+b(a+b)^*b}`$
- L2 = all words that contain the substring aba
  - $`\mathbf{r2 = (a+b)^*aba(a+b)^*}`$
- their TGs are shown below
  - TG(L1) on the top and TG2(L2) on the bottom

![sum pro clo](./img/r03.png)

---
- L1+L2 in REs: $`\mathbf{r1+r2 = [a(a+b)^*a+b(a+b)^*b] + [(a+b)^*aba(a+b)^*]}`$
- in TG: ![sum](./img/r04.png)

---
- L1L2 in REs: $`\mathbf{r1r2 = [a(a+b)^*a+b(a+b)^*b] [(a+b)^*aba(a+b)^*]}`$
- in TG: ![pro](./img/r05.png)

---

- L1* in REs: $`\mathbf{r1^* = [a(a+b)^*a+b(a+b)^*b]^*}`$
- in TG: ![clo](./img/r06.png)

---

Complements and intersections
---
- If L is a language over alphabet Œ£, its complement L' or $\bar{L}$  is the language over Œ£ of all words that are not in L.
  - the complement of the complement of L is L: (L')'=L

‚òØ Theorem 2: regular languages are closed under complement
---
- The complement of a regular language L is also a regular language
  - prove by FA: 
    - L is RE ‚Üí FA(L), 
    - flip FA's states ‚Äî‚Äî final to non-final and non-final to final
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è - is flipped to be ¬±, ¬± is flipped to be -
    - then, w ‚àâ FA ‚Üí w ‚àà FA' and w ‚àà FA ‚Üí w ‚àâ FA', i.e. all words of L' are in FA'
    - ‚à¥ L' is also a regular language


üçé Example 2: Find the FA' of a given FA
---
- A FA accepts only `aba` and `abb`:
  - ![r07](./img/r07.png)
- FA' accepts all words except `aba` and `abb`:
  - ![r08](./img/r08.png)

---

‚òØ Theorem 3: regular languages are closed under intersection
---
- The intersection of two regular languages is also a regular language
- L1, L2 are REs ‚Üí L1 ‚à© L2 is also a regular language
- prove by DeMorgan's law: L1 ‚à© L2 = (L1'+L2')'
  - L1, L2 are RLs ‚áí L1', L2' are RLs ‚áí L1'+L2' is RL ‚áí (L1'+L2')' is RL

üçé Example 3
---
Given Œ£ = {a,b} and
- L1 = all strings with a double a
  - $`\mathbf{r_1 = (a+b)^*aa(a+b)^*}`$
- L2 = all strings with an even number of a's
  - $`\mathbf{r_2 = b^*(ab^*ab^*)^*}`$

- There are FA1(L1) at the top and FA2(L2) at the bottom:
  - ![r10](./img/r10.png)

---

‚ù∂ Find L1 ‚à© L2
- ‚ë† by De Morgan's Law (L1' ‚à™ L2')'
  - FA1' at the top and FA2' at the bottom:
  - ![r11](./img/r11.png)

- ‚ë° Simplify FA1' by Kleene's theorem
  - Drag out the - and + ‚Üí
  - ![r12](./img/r12.png)

- drop the rejecting state x3 then eliminate x2 ‚Üí
  - ![r13](./img/r13.png)
- ‚à¥ $`\mathbf{r_1'=(b+ab)^*(a+œµ)}`$

---

- ‚ë¢ simplify FA2' similarly
  - Drag out the - and + ‚Üí
  - ![r14](./img/r14.png)
- eliminate state 2 ‚Üí
  - ![r15](./img/r15.png)
- ‚à¥ $`\mathbf{r_2'=(b+ab^*a)^*(ab^*)}`$
- $`\mathbf{r_1'+r_2'=(b+ab)^*(a+œµ)+(b+ab^*a)^*(ab^*)}`$
- From which, its is challenging to build an FA = $`\mathbf{(r_1'+r_2')'}`$ 
  - even though it can be done with Kleene's theorem
  - and the state flipping technique above
---
‚ù∑ Find FA1'+FA2' without RE as the intermediary
- from FA1' and FA2' below
  - ![r16](./img/r16.png)

- combined states
  - z1+ = x1¬± or y1-
  - z2+ = x1¬± or y2+
  - z3+ = x2+ or y1-
  - z4+ = x2+ or y2+
  - z5 = x3 or y1-
  - z6+ = x3 or y2+

- transition table

| state | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| z1¬± | z4 | z1 |
| z2+ | z3 | z2 |
| z3+ | z6 | z1 |
| z4+ | z5 | z2 |
| z5  | z6 | z5 |
| z6+ | z5 | z6 |

- FA1'+FA2'
  - ![r17](./img/r17.png)
- flip the states in FA1'+FA2', we get
  - FA1 ‚à© FA2, i.e. L1 ‚à© L2
  - ![r18](./img/r18.png)
- simplify FA1 ‚à© FA2 with Kleene's theorem
- eliminate z2 and z6
  - ![r19](./img/r19.png)
- eliminate z3
  - ![r20](./img/r20.png)
- ‚à¥ the RE defines L1‚à©L2 is
  - $`\mathbf{(b + abb^*ab)^*a(a + bb^*aab^*a)(b + ab^*a)^*}`$
  - all words with an even num¬≠ber of a's and a double a somewhere in it

---

Prove theorem 3 directly by constructing FA
---
To construct FA3=FA1 ‚à© FA2, follow the way of building FA1 ‚à™ FA2, 
- but a z state is assigned final only when both  the corresponding x-state and the corre¬≠sponding y-state are final states.
- Now FA 3 accepts only strings that reach final states simulta¬≠neously on both machines.


üçé Example 4
---
Given FA1 and FA2, build FA3 = FA1 ‚à© FA2.
- FA1: all words with a double a in them somewhere
- ![fa1](./img/ca2.png)

- FA2: EVEN-EVEN
- ![fa2](./img/ee.png)

- Transition table of FA1

| state\input | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -x1  | x2 | x1 |
| x2 | x3 | x1 |
| +x3 | x3 | x3 |

- Transition table of FA2

| state\input | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ¬±y1 | y3 | y2 |
|  y2 | y4 | y1 |
| y3 | y1 | y4 |
| y4 | y2 | y3 |

- FA3 tracks the transition on both FA1 and FA2, each state in FA3 will combine the states from FA1 and FA2 based on their transitions
  - $z_{start}=x_{start} \text{ or } y_{start}$
  - $z_{next}$ after letter œÉ = ($x_{next}$ after letter œÉ) or ($y_{next}$ after letter œÉ) 
  - +z contains both final states from FA1 or FA2

- Transition table of FA3

| FA3 | FA1+FA2 | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -z1 | -x1 or ¬±y1 | z2 | z3 |
| z2  | x2 or y3 | z4 | z5 |
| z3  | -x1 or y2 | z6 | z1 |
| +z4 | +x3 or ¬±y1 | z7 | z8 |
| z5  | -x1 or y4 | z9 | z10 |
| z6  | x2 or y4 | z8 | z10 |
| z7 | +x3 or y3 | z4 | z11 |
| z8 | +x3 or y2 | z11 | z4 |
| z9  | x2 or y2 | z11 | z1 |
| z10 | -x1 or y3 | z12 | z5 |
| z11| +x3 or y4 | z8 | z7 |
| z12| x2 or ¬±y1 | z7 | z3 |

- ![r21](./img/r21.png)
- Here, the intersection machine FA1 ‚à© FA2 is identical to [the union machine FA1 ‚à™ FA2](./kt.md) except that it has only one final state


üçé Example 3'
---
Rework example 2 with the shorter way as Example 4

![r22](./img/r22.png)

- the transition table of FA3 = FA1 ‚à© FA2

| state | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| z1- = x1- or y1¬± | z4 | z1 |
| z2 = x1- or y2 | z3 | z2 |
| z3 = x2 or y1¬± | z6 | z1 |
| z4 = x2 or y2 | z5 | z2 |
| z5+ = x3+ or y1¬±  | z6 | z5 |
| z6 = x3+ or y2 | z5 | z6 |
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Here z5+ = x3+ `or` y1¬± ‚â° accepted by FA1 `and` FA2

- FA3 = FA1 ‚à© FA2

![r23](./img/r23.png)


üçé Example 5
---
Given FA1 and FA2, 
- FA1: all words that begin with an a
  - $`\mathbf{a(a+b)^*}`$
- FA2: all words that end with an a
  - $`\mathbf{(a+b)^*a}`$

build FA3 = FA1 ‚à© FA2,
- all words that begin and end with the letter a
  - $`\mathbf{a(a+b)^*+a}`$

| FA1 | FA2 |
|:---: |:---: |
| ![r24a](./img/r24a.png) | ![r24b](./img/r24b.png) |

- the transition table of FA3 = FA1 ‚à© FA2

| state | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| z1- = x1- or y1- | z2 | z3 |
| z2+ = x2+ or y2+ | z2 | z4 |
| z3 = x3 or y1- | z5 | z3 |
| z4 = x2+ or y1- | z2 | z4 |
| z5 = x3 or y2+  | z5 | z3 |

- FA3 = FA1 ‚à© FA2
  - ![r25](./img/r25.png)

- FA3 = FA1 ‚à™ FA2
  - put `+` at any state with `x2 or y2`:
