__Finite automata__

_ict chapter 5_


Introduction
---
- Finite automata (FA) are one of the mathematical models of computation
  - called finite state automata (FSA)
- A FA has a finite set of states
  - it transits from states to states based on the current states and inputs
  - it has one start state and zero or more end states

üçé Demo
---
Run the FA with input strings `a, aa, aaa, aaaa` over $Œ£=\lbrace a \rbrace$ separately:

![a‚Å∫](./img/s20.png)

- `‚äñ` is the start state, `‚äï` is the final state
- if a string $s$ runs the $FA$ into its final state we say
  - FA accepts, or recognizes $s$, denoted as $s‚ààFA$
  - otherwise, FA rejects the string, denoted as $s‚àâFA$
- if $‚àÄs‚ààL: s‚ààFA$, we say language $L$ is defined by the $FA$, or
  - $FA$ accepts $L$
- the FA above accepts string {a,aa,aaa,‚ãØ}, i.e. the language $a^+$


Formal definition of FA
---
A FA is a 5-tuple $(Q,Œ£,q_0,A,Œ¥)$  where

- $Q$ is a finite set of states
- $Œ£$ is a finite input alphabet
- $q_0‚ààQ$ is the initial or start state
- $A‚äÜQ$ is the set of accepting states
- $Œ¥:Q√óŒ£‚ÜíQ$ is the transition function

The transition function $Œ¥(q,œÉ)$ means

- The FA transits from state $q$ to state $q'=Œ¥(q,œÉ)$ 
  - if it is in state $q‚ààQ$ and receives the input $œÉ‚ààŒ£$
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For each state, every letter in $Œ£$ and the next state must be specified


Related terms
---
- accepting state is also called 
  - halting state, terminal state, or final state
- FA is also called
  - finite acceptor, or language recognizer, 
  - since its sole job is to accept or recognize certain input strings and reject others
- ‚ö†Ô∏è FAs accept no language if 
  - they have no initial or final states, or
  - their final states cannot be reached because
    - they disconnected from other states, or
    - there are no arrows pointing at them


üí° Demo
---
Let $Œ£=\lbrace a,b\rbrace, Q=\lbrace x,y,z\rbrace$, and $Œ¥:Q√óŒ£‚ÜíQ$ be defined in the table below

| input | a | b |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `‚äñ` x | y | z |
| y | x | z |
| `‚äï` z | z | z |

The transition function can be represented with the *transition graphs* below in three conventions:

- convention 1

![conv1](./img/c1.png)

- convention 2

![conv2](./img/c2.png)

- convention 3

![conv3](./img/c3.png)

- or simply,

![conv4](./img/c4.png)

- Run the FA with `aaaabba, bbaabbbb`
- This FA accepts $`\mathbf{(a+b)^*b(a+b)^*}`$

üçé Building FAs given REs or languages
---
- $\mathbf{(a+b)^+}$
  - the set of all strings except $\mathbf{œµ}$

![abp](./img/abp.png)

- ---
- $\mathbf{(a+b)^*}$
  - `¬±` means the state is both initial and final

![all](./img/all.png)


---

Two types of FAs that accept NO languages
---
- FAs that have no final states
 ![no1](./img/no1.png)
- FAs whose final states cannot be reached from the start sate
 ![no21](./img/no21.png)
 ![no22](./img/no22.png)

- ---
- all words over alphabet $Œ£=\lbrace a,b\rbrace$ with even number of letter

  ![even](./img/even.png)

- ---
- $\mathbf{a(a+b)^*}$
  - all words begin with $a$

![aall](./img/aall.png)

- or with two final states

![two finals](./img/f2.png)

- or with more final states
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è there is no unique FA for a given language

![four finals](./img/f4.png)

- ---
-  L = {`aaa`, `bbb`}
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è any finite languages can be built similarly

![a3b3](./img/a3b3.png)

- ---
- all words containing a triple letter, either `aaa` or `bbb`

![ca3b3](./img/ca3b3.png)

‰∑º Theorem
---
- A language acceptable by a FA can be defined by REs
- The language defined by a RE can be accepted by some FAs
- There are languages are neither accepted by FAs nor defined by REs
