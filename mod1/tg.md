How to construct concise FA?
---
![t1](./img/t1.png)

- relaxing the restriction of inputs of FA only one letter a time
-  read either one or two letters of the input string at a time 
-  change its state based on this input information


A machine that accepts only the word `baa`
---
- can read up to three letters at a time
- build with even fewer states

![t2](./img/t2.png)

- or even simpler

![t3](./img/t3.png)

- What will happen if we run `baabb` on these two machines?


Crash of a machine
---
- When an input string that `has not been completely read` reaches a state (final or otherwise) without outgoing edge that it can follow, 
  - we say that the input (or the machine) crashes at that state
  - Execution terminates and the input must be rejected
- An FA it is not possible for any input to crash 
  - since there is always an outgoing edge for each letter from each state
  

Two different ways that an input can be rejected
---
- trace a path ending a nonfinal state
- crash while being processed


A machine recognize all words that contain a double letter
---
![t4](./img/t4.png)

- the operator decides how many letters to read from the input string each time
- run `baa` on the machine
  - (b)(a)(a) rejected
  - (b)(aa) accepted
  - (ba)(a) or (baa) crash
- a string is `accepted` by a machine if it can `get to a final state by some way`


Multiple ways to the final states
---
![t5](./img/t5.png)

- `baab` can be accepted in 2 different ways
  - `(ba)(ab)` or `(baa)(b)`
- With FAs, there is only a unique path through the machine for every input string


transition graph
---
- abbreviated TG, is a collection of three things:
  1. A finite set of states
     - at least one start state
     - zero or more final states
  2. An finite alphabet Œ£ of letters from which input strings are formed
  3. A finite set of transitions (edge labels) that show 
     - how to go from some states to some others
       - there can be `zero or more` outgoing arrows
     - based on reading specified substrings of the input 
       - possibly even the null
string œµ
- A `successful path` through a TG is a series of edges begin¬≠ning at some start state (there may be several) and ending at a final state


üí° Run strings on a TG
---
![t6](./img/t6.png)

- run `abbaab, abba, abbaaabba, b, abbab`
  - `abbaab`: (abb)(œµ)(aa)(b)
  - `abba`: (abb)(œµ)(a)
  - `abbaaabba`: (abb)(œµ)(aa)(abb)(œµ)(a)
  - `b`: (b)
  - `abbab` crashes
- we can go through a œµ edge without consuming any letter

œµ edge allow for more than one start state
---
- two equivalent TGs

![t7](./img/t7.png)

- and

![t8](./img/t8.png)

- every FA is a TG
  - but not every TG is a FA


üçé Typical TGs
---
- ‚ë† TG of the null language $Œ¶$
  - ![t9](./img/t9.png)

- since there is no final state
  - there must be a final state to be able to accept anything
- ---
- ‚ë° TG accepts only œµ
  - ![ta](./img/ta.png)
  - no edges for any other string
- Any TG with some start state that is also a final state will always accept œµ
  - also true for FAs
- The following TGs also only accept œµ
  - ![tb](./img/tb.png)
- or ![tc](./img/tc.png)

- or ![td](./img/td.png)
- or ![te](./img/te.png)

---

- ‚ë¢ TG accepts only `œµ, baa, abba`
  - how to generalize this to any finite language recognizer?

![tf](./img/tf.png)

- Anything read while in the + state will cause a crash 
  - because the ‚äñ state has no outgoing edges
---
- ‚ë£ TG accepts all words ending in b
  - ![tg](./img/tg.png)
- RE: $\mathbf{(a+b)^*b}$
- FA accepts the same language
  - ![tg2](./img/tg2.png)

---

- ‚ë§ TG accepts all words that begin and end with different letters

![th](./img/th.png)

---
- ‚ë• TG accepts all words in which the a 's occur only in even clumps and that end in three or more b's

![ti](./img/ti.png)

---
- ‚ë¶ EVEN-EVEN

![tj](./img/tj.png)


Challenges with TG
---
- ‚ë† The possible factoring schemes must be exhausted to determine whether a given string is accepted or rejected

![tk](./img/tk.png)

- Does the TG above accept `abbbabbbabba`?
  - Yes, in 3 way
- ‚ë° There are infinite ways of grouping the let¬≠ters of an input string if œµ-edges allowed
  - (a)(b)
  - (a)œµ(b)
  - (a)œµœµ(b)
  - ...
  - (a)œµ‚Åø(b)

- The TG below accepts only `aa` but in infinite paths

![tl](./img/tl.png)

- the œµ edges can be removed without changing the capability of the TG
  - they are reserved only for generalization
- another equivalent TG accepts only ab
  - ![tm](./img/tm.jpg)

- A TG whose œµ edges cannot be removed
  - ![tn](./img/tn.png)
- however, œµ-edges are never necessary at all
  - Any TG with œµ-edges always has some equivalent TGs without œµ-edges


Generalizing TG
---
![to](./img/to.png)

- the edge is generalized from a string to any string of a language
  - this language will be limited to regular language only


generalized transition graph (GTG)
---
A GTG is a collection of three things
- A finite set of states
  - at least one start state 
  - zero or more fi¬≠nal states
- An alphabet Œ£ of input letters
- Directed edges connecting some pairs of states, each labeled with a regular expression


üçé Examples
---
- A GTG  accepts all strings without a double b
  - ![tp](./img/tp.png)
- Notice that the word b takes a œµ-edge from start to middle

---

- there is no difference between the Kleene star closure for regular expressions and a loop in TGs or FAs, compare the FA
  - ![tq](./img/tq.png)
- and the GTG
  - ![tr](./img/tr.png)
- In the FA, we may loop in the middle state as many times as we want or `go straight to the third state`
- In the GTG, to not loop corresponds to taking the œµ choice from the b*


Nondeterminism
---
- A machine is nondeterministic if the path through it depends on both the input string and the operator's choice
- choices are inherent needed below
  - ![ts](./img/ts.png)
  - or in the equivalent one
  - ![tt](./img/tt.png)
- Another example of equivalence
