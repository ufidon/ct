Undecidable questions about CFGs
---
1. How can we tell whether or not two different CFGs define the same language?
2. Given a particular CFG, how can we tel l whether or not it is ambiguous?
3. Given a CFG that is ambiguous, how can we tell whether or not there is a different CFG that generates the same language but is not ambiguous?
4. How can we tell whether or not the complement of a given context-free language is also context-free?
5. How can we tell whether or not the intersection of two context-free languages is also context-free?
6. Given two CFGs, how can we tell whether or not they have a word in common?
7. Given a CFG, how can we tell whether or not there are any words that it does not gener­ate? (Is its language (a + b)* or not?)
- These questions are all `undecidable`
  - It had been proved that no algorithm can exist to answer them


Decidable questions about CFGs
---
1. Given a CFG, can we tell whether or not it generates any words at all? 
    - This is the ques­tion of `emptiness`.
2. Given a CFG, can we tell whether or not the language it generates is finite or infinite? 
   - This is the question of `finiteness`.
3. Given a CFG and a particular string of letters w , can we tell whether or not w can be generated by the CFG? 
   - This is the question of `membership`.


☯ Theorem 1: The emptiness of any CFG is decidable
---
Given any CFG G and CFL L generated by this CFG, there is an algorithm to determine
- `whether or not it can generate any words at all`
- i.e. `whether or not L=Φ`

Prove by construction:
- if S ⊨ ε, then L ≠ Φ
- if S ⊭ ε, G can be converted to CNF
  - if there is a production S → w, then t ∈ L
  - if there is no such productions, go through the following algorithm
  - ❶ eliminate nonterminal N
    - for each production with the form N → w, keep this production
    - delete all other productions with N on their left
    - replace all Ns on the right side of remaining productions by w
    - the new CFG G' may no longer be in CNF, but
      - Every word that can be generated from G' could have been generated by G. 
      - If G generated any words, then G' does also
  - ❷ Repeat ❶ until either it eliminates S or it eliminates no new nonterminals.
    - If S has been eliminated, then the CFG produces some words; 
    - if not, then it does not. 
      - Because if there were any words in the language, we could retrace the tree from any word and follow the path back to S (p1)
  - the productions in G is finite, so is ❶ and this algorithm


🍎 Example 1
---
- Decide the emptiness of the CFG below
  - S → XY
  - X → AX | AA
  - A → a
  - Y → BY | BB
  - B → b
- Solution
  - A → a, X → AX | AA ⊢ X → aX | aa ⊢ X → aa
    - `⊢` denote its LHS is `reduced` to its RHS
  - B → b, Y → BY | BB ⊢ Y → bY | bb ⊢ Y → bb
  - S → XY, X → aa, Y → bb ⊢ S → aabb ⊢ aabb
  - S is deleted so the CFG produces at least one word


🏃 Exercise 1
---
- Decide the emptiness of the CFG below
  - S → XY
  - X → AX
  - A → a
  - Y → BY | BB
  - B → b
- Solution
  - A → a, X → AX ⊢ X → aX
  - B → b, Y → BY | BB ⊢ Y → bY | bb ⊢ Y → bb
  - S → XY, Y → bb ⊢ S → Xbb 
  - S is still there so the CFG produces no word
