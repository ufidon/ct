Q1: determine RLs' equivalence, emptiness, finiteness, and membership
---
- How to decide the `emptiness` of a RL L, i.e. whether or not L =  Φ?
  - L is defined by an RE:
    - remove all stars
    - throw half of ${\boldsymbol{σ_1+σ_2}}$ to be ${\boldsymbol{σ_1}}$
    - remove all parenthesis
    - turn ${\boldsymbol{σ}}$ into σ, ${\boldsymbol{ε}}$ into ε
    - if the result is a word other than ε, then L ≠ Φ
  - L is defined by an FA:
    - 🅰 Convert the FA into a regular expression with Kleene's theorem
      - Every regular expression other than $\boldsymbol{Φ}$ defines some words
        - How about $\boldsymbol{r_1r_2⋯r_iΦr_j⋯r_n}$?
    - 🅱 An FA results in $\boldsymbol{Φ}$ in three cases:
      - ➀ The FA has no final states
      - ➁ the final state is disconnected from the start state
      - ➂ the final state is unreachable from the start state
      - ➁ ➂ can be determined by the `marking` method
        - ❶ mark the start state
        - ❷ from every marked state, 
          - follow its outgoing edges and mark the destination states
          - delete all these edges
        - ❸ repeat step ❷ until `no new` state is marked then stop
        - ❹ if any of the final states are marked, then the machine accepts some words otherwise it does not
    - 🅲 If this FA has N states and it accepts any words at all then it accepts some words with N or fewer letters
      - Test all words with no longer than N letters by running them on the FA
        - the number of such words is $|Σ|^N$
      -  If the FA accepts none of them, then it accepts no words at all
- How to determine the `equivalence` of two RL L₁ and L₂, i.e whether or not L₁ = L₂? 
  - by `L₁ = L₂ ↔ (L₁' ∩ L₂) ∪ (L₁ ∩ L₂') = Φ`
  - build an FA that defines (L₁' ∩ L₂) ∪ (L₁ ∩ L₂') then determine the emptiness of this FA 
- How to determine the `membership` of a word w with regard to a RL L? i.e. whether or not w∈L?
  - trace w on an FA that accepts L to see whether w is accepted by this FA
- How to determine the `finiteness` of a RL L?
  - |L|=∞ ↔ its RE contains a Kleene star on a nonempty factor
  - |L|=∞ ↔ its FA accepts at least one word w of length ∈ [N:2N), i.e N≤|w|<2N
    - N = |FA|, the number of the FA's states
    - the number of such words is: $\displaystyle \sum_{i=N}^{2N-1}|Σ|^i$

Q2: determine CFLs' emptiness, finiteness, and membership
---
- How to decide the `emptiness` of a CFL L generated by CFG G, i.e. whether or not L=Φ?
  - Based on the fact that any word in L can be backtraced to S
    - remove all ε-productions and unit-productions from G
    - convert G to general CNF
      - if S → t | ε then L ≠ Φ
      - if no such S → t nor N → t then L = Φ
      - if there are some N → t, try backtracking to S for each N → t
        - L = Φ if none can back to S else L ≠ Φ
- How to decide the `finiteness` of a CFL L generated by CFG G, i.e. whether or not |L|=∞?
  - |L|=∞ ↔ G has at least one self-embedded nonterminal
  - i.e. how to decide G has any self-embedded nonterminal or not?
- How to decide the `membership` of a word w with regard to CFL L generated by CFG G, i.e. whether or not w∈L?
  - or can w be generated by G? 
  - two methods: 
    - CYK algorithm
      - w∈L if ${ S∈P_{|w|} }$ else w∉L
    - TLT with all words W each of length |w|
      - w∈L if w∈W else w∉L


Q3: concepts
---
- What is a regular language?
- What is a nonregular language?
- What is a context-free language?
- What is a non-context-free language?
- What is CFG?
  - is ε a terminal or nonterminal?
- What is a regular grammar?
  - What is a semiword?
  - What is a semipath?  


Q4
---
- Compare and contrast PDAs and TMs


Q5
---
- Compare and contrast the pumping lemmas for regular language and context-free language


Q6
---
- What is grammar, semantics, syntax, and production?
- Compare derivation and left-most derivation of a word
- Compare syntax tree and total language tree?
- other names of syntax tree:
  - parse tree, generation tree, production tree or derivation tree
- What is an ambiguous grammar?
- What is an unambiguous grammar?


Q7
---
- Compare ε-production and unit-production
  - Is the empty string ε guaranteed to be a word of a CFL generated by a CFG which has one ε-production?
  - How to eliminate these two types of productions?
- Compare unproductive nonterminals and useless nonterminals
  - An unproductive nonterminal can't reach any leafs in the TLT
    - i.e. it cannot ever produce a string of terminals
  - An useless nonterminals N does not appear on any paths from S to any leafs in the TLT
    - i.e. either it is unproductive or it can't be reached from S in any derivations
- How to determine a nonterminal is useless?
  - How to remove it?

Q8
---
- Compare the the general form of CFG and `CNF (Chomsky Normal Form)`
  - both can be written in `BNF (Backus - Naur form)` with
    - arrows, vertical bars, termi­nals, and nonterminals 

| General |  CNF | Regular grammar (RG) |
|--|--|--|
| N → (t + N)*<br>- may have N → ε | - has productions of only two forms<br>❶ nonterminal → string of exactly two nonterminals<br>❷ nonterminal → one terminal<br>- can't have N → ε | - has productions of only two forms<br>❶ nonterminal → semiword<br>❷ nonterminal → word|


Q9

- Convert 
  - FA to CFG (RG)
  - RG to FA
  - FA to PDA
  - CFG to PDA
  - FA to TM
