Universal Algorithm Machine
---
- An algorithm is a `detailed, finite procedure`, 
  - but its definition is vague due to the unclear term "procedure."
- Algorithms can use `basic operations or vague actions`, 
  - prompting questions about valid steps.
- Early 20th-century goal: 
  - a `"universal algorithm machine"` with minimal operations to run any algorithm.
- Emil Post's 1936 `Post machine` aimed to recognize all human-defined languages, exceeding simpler models.
- `Post and Turing's machines` tested if all math problems could be solved algorithmically, possibly self-programming.


Post machine (PM)
---
a 5-element tuple (Œ£, QUEUE, START, READ, ADD):
- `Œ£`: the alphabet of input letters and a `special symbol #`
- `QUEUE or STORE`: 
  - a FIFO linear storage, 
    - letters go into it from its `tail` and out from its `head` one letter a time
      - by default, head on the left and tail on the right
    - initially contains the input string 
  - the `queue or store` alphabet `Œì` contains all characters can be used in the QUEUE
- `READ` states remove the `QUEUE head character` and branch accordingly
  - ![p00a](./img/p00a.png)
  - PMs are deterministic, so no two edges from the READ have the same label
    - nondeterministic PMs (nPMs) can be defined if two or more edges from the READ have the same label
      - it is proved that nPM ‚â° PM
  - There may be a branch for every character in Œ£ or Œì
  - the `Œµ or Œõ` branch means an empty QUEUE was read
- `ADD` states concatenate a character to the string in the QUEUE through its tail
  - ![p00b](./img/p00b.png)
  - No branching can take place at an ADD state
    - There may be an ADD state for every character in Œ£ or Œì
  - e.g. the following PM operation sequence converts an `empty` STORE to `abb`
    - ![p00d](./img/p00d.png)
- `An unenterable START` state and `0 or more halt states` called `ACCEPT` and `REJECT`
  - ![p00c](./img/p00c.png)
  - a read character in a READ state without outgoing edges crashes the PM
  - this is equivalent to taking a labeled edge into a REJECT state
  - ‚à¥ PMs can be drawn with or without REJECT states

üçé Example 1

‚ù∂ A PM that accepts {a‚Åøb‚Åø | n=0,1,2,3,‚ãØ}
- ![p01a](./img/p01a.png)
- trace `aaabbb`
- ![p01b](./img/p01b.png)

‚ù∑ A PM that accepts {a‚Åøb‚Åøa‚Åø | n=0,1,2,3,‚ãØ}
- ![p02a](./img/p02a.png)
- üìù trace `aaabbb`

‚òØ Theorem 1
---
Any language that can be accepted by a PM can be accepted by some TM.

Proof by simulating a PM on a TM.
- keep track of the PM QUEUE by the TM TAPE

| PM QUEUE | TM TAPE |
|:---:|:---:|
| x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇx‚ÇÉx‚ÇÑx‚ÇÖ | ![p03a](./img/p03a.png) |
| READ‚ÜíADD a‚ÜíREAD‚ÜíADD a‚ÜíADD b‚ÜíREAD | ![p03b](./img/p03b.png) |

- by duplicating PM ADD and READ on the TM TAPE

| PM Operation | TM Tape change | TM program |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ADD y | ![p03c](./img/p03c.png) |  ![p03d](./img/p03d.png) |
| ![p03e](./img/p03e.png) | | ![p03f](./img/p03f.png) |
| ![p03g](./img/p03g.png) | | ![p03h](./img/p03h.png) |

üçé Example 2
---
- Simulate PM P by a TM T 
  - the PM accepts {a‚Åøb‚Åø | n=0,1,2,3,‚ãØ}

| PM P | TM T |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![p04a](./img/p04a.png)| ![p04b](./img/p04b.png) |

- their corresponding states
- ![p04c](./img/p04c.png)
- trace `aabb` on T 
- ![p04d](./img/p04d.png)
- a short notation is applied
  - (a,b,c,d,e;=,D) stands for the instructions
    - (a,a,D)(b,b,D)(c,c,D)(d,d,D)(e,e,D)
    - D is direction L or R


‚òØ Theorem 2
---
There are subprograms that enable a PM to 
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ add a character to the head of the string in the QUEUE
  - `ADD FRONT b`:
  - ![p05a](./img/p05a.png)
  - ex. `ADD FRONT b` to  `pqr`
    - ![p05b](./img/p05b.png)
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ read the character off of the tail of the string
  - `SHIFT-RIGHT CYCLICALLY`:
  - ![p05c](./img/p05c.png)
  - ![p05d](./img/p05d.png)

‚òØ Theorem 3
---
Any language that can be accepted by a TM can be accepted by some PM.

Proof by constructing a PM equivalent to a given TM:
- track the TM TAPE
  - ![p06a](./img/p06a.png)
  - by
  - ![p06b](./img/p06b.png)
  - with
  - ![p06c](./img/p06c.png)
  -  a correspondence between `#` and the position of the `TAPE HEAD`
- the TM converts `cat` into `dog`
  - ![p06d](./img/p06d.png)
- simulate a left move

| TM Operation | TM TAPE | PM QUEUE | PM Operation | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| (X‚ÇÑ,Y,L) | ![p06e](./img/p06e.png) | `X‚ÇÉYX‚ÇÖX‚ÇÜX‚ÇáX‚Çà#X‚ÇÅX‚ÇÇ` | ![p06f](./img/p06f.png)  |

- Corner situation:
  - Crash of (X‚ÇÅ,Y,L) on ![p06g](./img/p06g.png)
  - which can be simulated by adding a test to see whether the first symbol in the QUEUE has become `#` in every PM simulation of a leftward TM move:
  - ![p06i](./img/p06i.png)
 
- A rightward TM move can be simulated symmetrically
- simulate initial state

| TM TAPE | PM QUEUE | PM initial sequence |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![p06i1](./img/p06i1.png) | ![p06i2](./img/p06i2.png) | ![p06i3](./img/p06i3.png) |



üçé Example 3

- Given a TM T:
  - ![p07a](./img/p07a.png)
  - that accepts all strings starting with a
