Input & output
---
- FAs are only language-acceptors
- Transducers, such as  Mealy and Moore machines, have output capabilities
- PDAs are not only language-acceptors
  - but also transducers by considering what is put into, popped from, or left in the STACK as output
- TMs always have as a natural output whatever is left on its TAP
  - when the processing of the TM terminates


Encoding numbers
---
- TMs can work as calculators by first encoding numbers as words in Œ£*
- ex. a natural number `n` can be encoded as a `string of n a's` 
  - e(0) = Œµ, e(1) = a, e(3) = aaa, etc.
  - this is called `unary encoding` because it uses one symbol
- If Œ£={a,b}, then every word in Œ£* can be interpreted as a sequence of numbers (strings of a's) separated internally by b's
  - ex. babbaaa = (0 a)b(1 a)b(0 a)b(3 a's) represents 0,1,0,3
  - he we assume that there is a group of a's at the beginning of the string and at the end even though these may be groups of `0 a`
- in this way, a TM can work as a calculator
  - `input numbers` represented by a string in Œ£*
  - `calculation` represented by a TM program
  - `output numbers` represented by another string in Œ£* left on the TAPE when the TM program terminates


üçé Example
---
- (p1) an ADDER accepts input a‚Åøba·µê representing n+m
  - inputs other than a‚Åøba·µê crashes the TM
  - n, m ‚àà ‚Ñï
- the result is a‚Åø‚Å∫·µê representing n+m


üçé Example
---
Build a TM that 
- adds two numbers presented in binary notation
- leaves the answer on the TAPE in binary notation

through
- (p2‚ù∂) an incrementer that accepts $(0+1)* representing n
  - leaves n+1 in $(0+1)* notation
- (p2‚ù∑) a decrementer that accepts $(0+1)* representing n
  - leaves n-1 in $(0+1)* notation
- (p3) the binary ADDER that accepts $(0+1)*$(0+1)* representing n+m
  - leaves n+m in $0*$(n+m) in binary
  - üèÉ trace `$10$0110` which leaves `$00$1000` on the tape


Computer
---
a TM has the property that for every word it accepts, at the time it halts, it leaves one solid string of Œ£* on its TAPE starting in cell 0 
- The input string is called the `input` (a sequence of `nonnegative integers`)
- The string left on the TAPE is called the `output` (a sequence of nonnegative integers)


Computable functions
---
A computer has acted like a mathematical `function`
- if it takes `a sequence of numbers as input` and leaves only `one number as output`

Any operation that is defined on `all sequences of K numbers` (K‚â•1) and that can be performed by a TM is called `Turing-computable` or just `computable`


‚òØ Theorem 1
---
The following operations are computable
- addition: x+y
- (p5) simple subtraction: x ‚à∏ y = x-y if x‚â• y else 0
- (p6-9) MAX(x,y) = x if x‚â•y else y
- (p10.t) IDENTITY(n) = n
- (p10.b) SUCCESSOR(n)=n+1
- (p11) select-the-i·µó ∞-out-of-n-numbers function: SELECT/i/n(a‚ÇÅ,a‚ÇÇ,‚ãØ,a·µ¢,‚ãØ,a‚Çô)
- (p12-16) multiplication: n√óm=nm
- (p17) SQRT


Church's thesis
---
- The TM is believed to be the ultimate calculating mechanism
- It is believed that there are no functions that can be defined by humans, whose calculation can be described by any well-defined mathematical algorithm that people can be taught to perform, that cannot be computed by TMs


TM roles
---
- a computer as a transducer
- a decision procedure as an acceptor
- a language L generator as printing all word from L delimited by #'s on a blank TAPE after some calculation
  - the order in which these words occur does not matter and any word may be repeated in¬≠definitely
  - also called language enumerator


‚òØ Theorem 2
---
- any language that can be generated by a TM can be ac¬≠cepted by some TM
- any language that can be accepted by a TM can be generated by some TM
- This is why the languages accepted by TMs were called `recursively enumerable`


‚òØ Theorem 3
---
The words in a language L can be generated by a TM in `size order` if and only if L is recursive
